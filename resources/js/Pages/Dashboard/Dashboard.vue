        <h1>FAQ</h1>

        <p>What do I do now?</p>

        <p>Join the LaravelUK Slack Channel (see link at the top).
            This is where most of us will be, there is also a #larahack channel to join</p>

        <p>Decide if you are working alone or in a team.</p>

        <p>Once decided, the leader should create a project at the top, and team members (if any) can then request to
            join the project by viewing it and clicking 'join'</p>

        <p>Work on your project :-)</p>

        <p>In 3 days from now at 23:00 the event will end. By this time, you should cease working and post an image of
            your latest commit (and time) to the larahack on the LaravelUK slack channel</p>

        <p>The judging process now begins</p>

        <p>We ask everyone to vote for a project in each of the categories.</p>

        <p>In 1 weeks time, we will total the votes and announce the winners</p>

        <p>If you won, we will contact you via the email address you signed up with.</p>
